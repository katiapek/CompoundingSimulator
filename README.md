## ðŸŽ¯ Why this project

This tool is designed for traders who want to understand the power of compounding applied to their strategies:
- Adapted Formula:
	A = P Ã— (1 + r/n)^(nÃ—t)
- A: Ending balance
- P: Starting balance
- r: Expected return per period (based on expectancy)
- n: Number of compounding periods per cycle
- t: Number of cycles
- Trading context: We compound risk per trade (as % of balance), adjusted for wins, losses, taxes, and cash flows.
- Benefits:
  1. Quickly visualize long-term account growth.
  2. Experiment with different strategies & risk parameters.
  3. Learn how expectancy and Kelly Criterion influence outcomes.
